# Blendspaces in Unreal Engine

Blendspaces are a powerful feature in Unreal Engine used for blending between multiple animations based on input parameters. They are commonly used for smooth transitions between different character movements, such as walking, running, and crouching. In this guide, we'll explore blendspaces and their various uses in Unreal Engine.

## Understanding Blendspaces

Blendspaces are essentially a collection of animation sequences arranged in a grid or 2D space. Each animation sequence represents a specific movement or action, and the grid's axes represent input parameters, such as movement speed or direction. By interpolating between these animations based on input parameters, blendspaces create smooth and seamless transitions between different character movements.

##  Blendspaces used in this Project
